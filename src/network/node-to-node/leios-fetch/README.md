# LeiosFetch

`LeiosFetch` is the mini-protocol responsible for fetching Endorser Blocks (EBs)
and their transaction payloads from peers. It is a pull-based protocol: the
client explicitly requests either a full EB or a subset of its transactions
(identified by a bitmap), and the server streams the response.

EBs are discovered via [LeiosNotify](../leios-notify/README.md); once a node
decides it wants a block or its transactions, it uses `LeiosFetch` to retrieve
the data.

## Codecs

The messages depicted in the state machine follow this CDDL specification:

```cddl
;; messages.cddl
{{#include messages.cddl}}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> The CBOR tags in this specification are provisional (`MsgClientDone` at `[9]`
> in particular). The `endorser_block`, `bitmaps`, and `tx` types remain
> underspecified (`any`) pending further protocol design, including the
> length-definite encoding for `txList`. Additionally, the protocol is known
> to be incomplete: catch-up oriented batch request messages are likely to be
> added, and the bitmap-based transaction request structure
> (`MsgLeiosBlockTxsRequest`) may change significantly as the roaring bitmap
> encoding is still under discussion. See
