# LeiosNotify

> This protocol is **proposed** and not yet part of the Cardano mainnet. It is

`LeiosNotify` is the mini-protocol responsible for announcing Endorser Blocks
(EBs) and offering EB bodies and their associated transaction closures to peers.
It is a pull-based protocol: the client drives progress by requesting the next
notification, and the server replies with whatever is available.

Leios introduces Endorser Blocks as a mechanism to endorse and achieve consensus
on transaction inclusion independently and overlayed on the Praos block chain.
`LeiosNotify` is the dissemination layer that lets peers discover new EBs before
fetching them via [LeiosFetch](../leios-fetch/README.md). The protocol is
intended to run in a pipelined fashion where the client issues multiple
`MsgRequestNext` even before receiving a notification, so that the server can
push announcements to downstream peers with minimal latency.
