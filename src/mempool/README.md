In Cardano, for blocks to have useful data, they have to contain transactions,
which are codifications of operations on the Ledger state that only some
authorized actors can enact. Notice that such transactions are what makes up the
contents of the block. In one way, one could see the ledger as being able to
validate transactions, and by implication full blocks as those are mainly
collections of transactions.

The Mempool is the abstract component of the node that stores transactions which
are valid on top of the latest known Ledger State (the one at the tip of the
chain selected by [Chain Selection](../consensus/chainsel.md) in the Consensus
layer). The validity of transactions is defined by the Ledger layer. Notice a
change in the selected chain should trigger a prompt revalidation of the pending
transactions to discard those that became invalid on the new selection. Such
collection of valid transactions will be requested by the Consensus layer to
[forge new blocks](../consensus/forging.md).

Once a transaction has been included in some block, it cannot be a _pending
transaction_ anymore, in fact from that point onwards it will be an _invalid
transaction_, as in Cardano every transaction consumes at least one UTxO, in
this case consumed by the instance of the transaction that was included in a
block.

While only nodes that forge new blocks will use these transactions to create
blocks, non-block-producing nodes are still expected to diffuse transactions to
their peers. **All participating nodes** must be able to receive, validate, and
distribute transactions.

The [`TxSubmission2`](../network/node-to-node/txsubmission2) miniprotocol is the
one used to diffuse the pending transactions through the network.

To be able to diffuse transactions through `TxSubmission2` and to fulfill the
requirements of the Consensus layer, any mempool implementation has the
following requirements:

- Acquiring a snapshot of valid transactions for a newly forged block should be
  as fast as possible, as it will delay all other steps in the diffusion of such
  a block. This is required by the Consensus layer for [forging
  blocks](../consensus/forging.md).
- Cursor-like access to pending transactions. This is required by the
  `TxSubmission2` protocol.
- Re-validation on a new selected chain: it is useless to keep transactions that
  are no longer valid in the mempool. This is an inherent requirement of the
  mempool itself.

Notice that _what_ a transaction actually is defined by the Ledger layer and it
depends on the current era at the tip of the chain. The Ledger layer provides
mechanisms to translate transactions from older eras to more recent ones. The
original transaction is the one that will be forwarded to other peers, i.e. the
"translated" version of the transaction _is not sent_ over the network.
